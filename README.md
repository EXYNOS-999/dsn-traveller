## Requirements ##
This depends on rust nightly, I use it with rust nightly 2018-05-14,
and on a number of forks of the various [ruma](https://www.ruma.io/) crates with patches that I will upstream soon -
this is mainly blocked on [ruma-client](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client/) getting updated for
[ruma-api-macros 0.2.2](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api-macros/releases/tag/0.2.2),
which will also allow for a more current rust nightly version.

If you use NixOS, the provided `shell.nix` contains everything you need, which you can
[automatically load](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell) via:
```
direnv allow .
```
